We will be reusing project files from last time.

Start by editing the **grid.html** and **grid.css** files in this repo. Add the style code at the end of the style.css file.

We will be building the layout in layout1.png

Inside of body, add a div with id "body-container";
 - create a header tag
  - create an h1 tag with text "Header" inside the header tag. Make sure the Header text is centered.
 - create an aside tag
  - create an unordered list of 5 elements, each with text Item 1 - 5 inside of it
   - style the list so that the text is centered in the container.
 - add an article tag inside the "body-container" div
  - add 3 images inside of it, with width and height 150px, source assets/image1.png.
  - make them spaced out evenly inside their parent;
  give the article tag a padding of 20px;
 - create a footer tag, with an h4 tag with text "Footer" inside of it. Make sure the Footer text is centered

Style the "body-container" div:
 - add a min-width: 100%; to it
 - add padding: 35px;
 - make it display grid.
 - define your columns and rows using grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows
 - aside tag should be 40% the size of the article tag.
  - add a gap between the items in the grid, using grid-gap, of 30px;
 - header an footer should be of height 80px
